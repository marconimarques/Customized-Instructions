The text: When AI Makes Everything Cheap, What Becomes Valuable? 
Marc Andreessen recently predicted that “AI will make everything so cheap, it’ll break the economy.” It’s a bold claim. And it’s wrong, but not in the way most people think. I believe the opposite is true: AI will make execution cheap, which means differentiation becomes priceless. When costs drop to near-zero, what remains scarce? Not goods. Not information. Not production capacity. What remains scarce is: Taste. Trust. Clarity. Identity. AI will write the copy. It will generate the image. It will build the product. But humans will still decide what’s worth saying, showing, and building. This is the same illusion we saw with the rise of the internet, ecommerce, and low-code platforms: the tools become easier, but the outcomes don’t. Distribution got democratized. So did creation. But the value didn’t follow the tools. It followed the operators. The economy isn’t built on cost. It’s built on desire. And desire isn’t solved by AI. It’s revealed by insight, empathy, and taste. In the age of AI, the value shifts upstream to those who can frame the problem before AI touches it, to those who know what “good” looks like when everyone can create, to those who can lead others through noise, not just generate more of it. So no, the economy won’t break. It will evolve. And if you’re still trying to win on output, speed, or volume, you’re already behind.
