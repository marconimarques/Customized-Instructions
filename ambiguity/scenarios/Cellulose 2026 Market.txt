1- The average price of pulp fell by about 22% in 2025 compared to 2024 (China effect).

2- The company announced a cut of around 3.5% in pulp production throughout 2025 due to the challenging scenario in the global market = tariffs and problems in the global production chain.

3- Several new pulp plants in China began operations in 2025 (with large capacities) = Liansheng: 1.6 Mt/year / Huatai: 0.6 Mt/year / Nine Dragons Paper: 0.65 Mt/year, resulting in more supply = lower prices = lower margins, in addition to a reduction in Suzano's sales to China.

4- Approximately 80% of the debt is denominated in foreign currency (mainly USD).

5- In 3Q25, adjusted EBITDA totaled R$ 5.2 billion, a drop of 20% compared to 2024, and cash generation also fell.

These 5 points are the same for:
 a) Mining
 b) Steelmaking
 c) Retail (mainly white goods)
 d) Animal protein
 e) Automotive sector

Understand: Amateurs think about holidays, World Cup and elections. Professionals think about changes in the rules of the game:
 1- Expensive world (interest rates + tariffs).
 2- Greater competition (China).
 3- Markets with no margins.
 4- Excess volatility.
 5- "Sameness of quality" without differentiation.

Change "we are going into a brutal year" to "we are going into a brutal cycle" – and for companies it is important to have professionals who understand this difference, because survival is no longer a luxury; margins are.
