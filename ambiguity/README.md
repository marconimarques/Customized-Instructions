# Ambiguity Coworker 

`ambiguity-coworker.md` is a reusable “thinking partner” prompt that helps turn messy scenarios into decision-grade clarity using critical thinking.

It is an example of practicing **augmentation**: humans and AI collaborating as coworkers to accelerate sense-making, decisions, and execution.

## What it does

- Anchors analysis to the source text you provide (scenario, memo, notes).
- Forces clarity with explicit assumptions instead of stalling on missing data.
- Produces a concrete point of view: tradeoffs, a hard call, and next actions.

## How to use

1. Open Codex or Claude Code CLI's.

Examples:

- Run `ambiguity-coworker.md` to analyze `scenarios\'Cellulose 2026 Market.txt` giving me a first view about in which ways logistics can be a source of value creation.
- Run `ambiguity-coworker.md` to check `scenarios/When AI Makes Everything Cheap.txt` considering what I must take into account in my digital product strategy.
- Run `ambiguity-coworker.md` to analyze `scenarios/When AI Makes Everything Cheap.txt` providing me with a north start to move forward in my AI literacy.

## What’s in this repo

- `ambiguity-coworker.md`: the coworker/instruction template.
- `scenarios/`: example scenario inputs you can analyze.

## Notes

- The output is only as good as the input; treat it as a decision aid, not truth.
- All `.md` file development was done using Codex.
